Welcome to my blog.
Yes, a "blog". An entity that defined an era of the Internet, back when the Internet was an escape from the life happening outside. In 2026, we're the opposite. We want real life to escape from the Internet.
Times are different, mainly because of us. The people. This mass that gathers around glowing rectangles, distracted, voluntarily or involuntarily.
