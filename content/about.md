I'm Tiago Jacinto, and this is my personal corner of the internet.

Here you'll find my thoughts on technology, music, cinema, books, and everything that catches my attention. I write about things I find interesting, share quotes that resonate with me, and occasionally link to content worth reading.

When I'm not writing, I enjoy discovering new music, watching films, and reading a bit of everything. This blog serves as a digital garden where I cultivate ideas and share discoveries.
