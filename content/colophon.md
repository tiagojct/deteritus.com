## About This Site

**Deteritus** is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast and flexible static site generator. The site uses a custom theme focused on typography and readability.

## Typography

The main typeface is Iowan Old Style, a modern serif font designed by John Downer. It takes inspiration from classic old-style typefaces while remaining highly readable on screens. Code is set in SF Mono.

## Design Principles

- **Minimalism**: Focus on content, not decoration
- **Readability**: Generous line height, comfortable measure
- **Performance**: No JavaScript frameworks, minimal dependencies
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, sufficient color contrast, respects system preferences

## Features
